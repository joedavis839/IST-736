Text mining
The was another python project, this time with a focus on text mining. This is also my first group project. One important
learning advancement made with this project was using APIs to obtain the data used for analysis and finding insights.
Many machine learning and general data science techniques were repeated, including: TFIDF, TF, API usage, general data exploration,
Count Vectoriztaion, Naive Bayes, Decision trees, Support Vectors Machines, and Latent Dirichlet Allocation.
